"""Gate: the patrol runner feeds LIVE state to the pure predicate, and says what it examined.

Origin (issue #95). `tests/test_board_intake_recorded.py` ships the predicate for "an
OPEN issue with no intake row" and is wired into the audit — but its live test calls
`board_intake_problems([], rows, complete_board=False)`: an EMPTY board. The forward leg
therefore examines **0 open issues** and the reverse leg is skipped by design. A gate
that has never been asked a question reports the same green as one that passes.

`tools/patrol_host_state.py` is part (b) — the host-side runner that supplies the input.
This file is its gate, and it asserts the four properties that make the runner worth
having, each with a probe that would fail on the shape it forbids:

1. **The board is read WHOLE.** The reverse leg is sound only over the full board, so a
   filtered read must never be what the runner passes. Probed at the argv the runner
   builds, not at its prose.
2. **A non-empty board with a missing leg is REPORTED, non-vacuously.** The predicate is
   injected, so the probe drives a board that must fail and asserts the count is non-zero
   — the acceptance criterion #95 names.
3. **A board that could not be read is NOT a clean board.** rc=2 with the failure named,
   never rc=0 over zero issues. This is the failure mode that makes a patrol worse than
   useless: a broken read rendering as a passing one.
4. **A leg that is not run says so.** The cron-thinness leg (#54 part b) has no predicate,
   so the runner prints it as NOT RUN with the reason — an absent leg is a different fact
   from a passing leg, and the two must never render the same.

Run:  python3 tests/test_patrol_host_state.py
Exit: 0 all checks pass, 1 a check failed.
