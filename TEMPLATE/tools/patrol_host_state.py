"""Patrol runner: feed LIVE host state into the pure board/ledger predicates.

Origin (issue #95). `tests/test_board_intake_recorded.py` ships the PREDICATE for
"an OPEN issue with no intake row" and is wired into the audit — but its live test
calls `board_intake_problems([], rows, complete_board=False)`, an EMPTY board, so
the forward leg examines **0 open issues** and the reverse leg is skipped by design.
Its own docstring says why: a repo gate cannot call `gh`, so part (b) — a host-side
runner that fetches the board — is "a later step and not this file's acceptance".
#56 closed with part (b) out of scope, and #54 part (b) is the same shape: one
mechanism, two call sites. This file is that mechanism.

**#117 added the second call site.** `tests/test_close_board_recorded.py` asserts a close
row RECORDED the board state it observed (`board=closed`); nothing verified the
observation was TRUE, so two close rows declared a board close that had never happened
and the gate read clean over both. The board-close leg below closes that gap: it reads
the close rows through the GATE's own predicate and constant and reports every
declaration the live board contradicts.

**A green predicate with no live input is a gate that has never been asked a
question.** So this runner supplies the input, and it prints each leg's own coverage
count beside its verdict: "0 problems" over "0 examined" and "0 problems" over "29
examined" are different facts, and only the second is a finding.

Four things it does deliberately:

- **Reads the board WHOLE** (`--state all`, no filter). The reverse leg — an intake
  row naming a number the board never heard of — is sound only over the full board,
  so a partial list is never passed: `board_intake_problems` skips the leg instead
  of guessing, and a skipped leg is printed as SKIPPED, never as zero problems.
- **States the instant it read.** A claim about a live board describes it at an
  instant; without the instant the claim cannot be re-checked, and an uncheckable
  receipt is testimony, not evidence (skill section 11).
- **Names every leg it does NOT run, with the reason.** A leg that is silent for
  want of a predicate is a different fact from a leg that passed, and the two must
  never render the same.
- **Checks the close rows' board declarations against the board it already read**
  (#117). The offline gate asserts the token was RECORDED; this leg asserts the
  recorded state was TRUE, reading the rows through the gate's own `BOARD_TOKEN`
  and `INVARIANT_LANDED` so the two surfaces cannot drift into two definitions of
  one field. Freshness stays REPORTED — the read instant travels with the count and
  is never folded into the verdict, because a check that fails by construction
  carries no more information than one that cannot fail.

The board slug is derived from the git remote, so nothing here hardcodes a factory.

Run:  python3 tools/patrol_host_state.py
Exit: 0 no problems, 1 problems found, 2 the board could not be read.
